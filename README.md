## Web/Javascript Solution - [Link](http://robbyfletcher.github.io/Challenge)
After thinking about this problem, I had a thought; since social networks are 
typically web based, why not make this one web based? So I decided to create
a website to emulate this social network. 

# Challenge Time

## Introduction
Two words are friends if they have a Levenshtein distance of 1. That is, you
can add, remove, or substitute exactly one letter in word X to create word Y.
A word’s social network consists of all of its friends, plus all of their
friends, and all of their friends’ friends, and so on.

## Problem
Write a program in your favorite dynamic language that efficiently finds the
social network for any given word, using the word list provided.
